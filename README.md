# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, April 2023

## Theme
We went down the route of going back through time. With the progressive nature of 2D games, we knew that we could convey this type of theme through the design of each level. We start at a futuristic space theme, then go to a civil time period, and finally end on a midevil level.

## Game Play
The objective of this game is to traverse through each level of the platformer and ultimately travel back in time. 
The player's movement is controlled the "A" and "D" keys to go left and right, the space bar to jump, and left click to shoot with your weapon. The weapon can be used to give your character a boost if you shoot it in the opposite direction that you want to be launched in.

## Impediments
The biggest struggle that we had with this project was handling merge errors and branching/pull requests with github. 

## Implementation
Built using Godot 3.5
The bat enemy is from the Medieval Fantasy Character Pack by OcO. CC0 Licensed

The tilemap we used was from Kenny (https://kenney.nl/assets/abstract-platformer)

The shader used for the start and end menu was Starfield by iVader on (https://godotshaders.com/shader/starfield/)

The font used for the buttons is Share Tech by Carrois Apostrophe on Google Fonts. (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Share+Tech?query=Tech&category=Serif,Sans+Serif,Handwriting)

## Future Development
If we were to work on this in the future we would add more enemies, music/sound, and more levels.
